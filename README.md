# RocketMQ-Project

RocketMQ is an open-source distributed messaging and streaming platform like Kafka created by Alibaba. 
It is part of the Apache Software Foundation and is designed to handle large volumes of real-time data across a variety of use cases, including messaging, streaming, and event-driven architectures.

In this project, I created a producer responsible for sending order messages during shopping. 

The consumer functions as a delivery system to generate delivery lists.
